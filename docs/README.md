When adding new documentation:

1. Create a new Markdown (.md) file in this directory

3. Follow the established format and style
4. Use clear headings and code blocks where appropriate
5. Include examples when possible

## Documentation Best Practices

- Keep documentation up to date as the codebase evolves
- Use simple, clear language
- Include visuals (diagrams, screenshots) when helpful
- Organize information with headings and lists
- Provide code examples for technical concepts
- Link between related documentation files

## Why Good Documentation Matters

Good documentation:
- Helps onboard new team members
- Serves as a reference for existing team members
- Reduces the "bus factor" (dependency on specific individuals)
- Makes the project more maintainable in the long term
- Saves time by avoiding repeated explanations
